    "# Question 2. Unigram Markov Chain Model\n",
    "\n",
    "You will build a Markov chain for the artist whose lyrics you scraped in Lab A. Your model will process the lyrics and store the word transitions for that artist. The transitions will be stored in a dict called `chain`, which maps each word to a list of \"next\" words.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if your song was [\"The Joker\" by the Steve Miller Band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgDU17xqNXo), `chain` might look as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "chain = {\n",
    "    \"some\": [\"people\", \"call\", \"people\"],\n",
    "    \"call\": [\"me\", \"me\", \"me\"],\n",
    "    \"the\": [\"space\", \"gangster\", \"pompitous\", ...],\n",
    "    \"me\": [\"the\", \"the\", \"Maurice\"],\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides words, you should include a few additional states in your Markov chain. You should have `\"<START>\"` and `\"<END>\"` states so that we can keep track of how songs are likely to begin and end. You should also include a state called `\"<N>\"` to denote line breaks so that you can keep track of where lines begin and end. It is up to you whether you want to include normalize case and strip punctuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for example, for [\"The Joker\"](https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/stevemillerband/thejoker.html), you would add the following to your chain:\n",

    "    \"cowboy,\": [\"yeah\", ...],\n",
    "    \"yeah\": [\"<N>\", ...],\n",
    "    \"<N>\": [\"Some\", ..., \"Come\"],\n",
    "    ...,\n",
    "    \"Come\": [\"on\", ...],\n",
