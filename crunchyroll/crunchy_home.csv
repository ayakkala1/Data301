            In the early 2050s, unknown life forms called “Oracle cells” begin their uncontrolled consumption of all life on Earth. Their ravenous appetite and remarkable adaptability earn them first dread, then awe, and finally the name “aragami”. In the face of an enemy completely immune to conventional weapons, urban civilization collapses, and each day humanity is driven further and further toward extinction. One single ray of hope remains for humanity. Following the development of “God Arcs”—living weapons which incorporate Oracle cells—their wielders are organized into an elite force.

            Living by the sea, protecting the sea, and journeying across the sea…They’re the BLUE MERMAIDS! Because of a shift in tectonic plates around 100 years ago, Japan lost much of its area to submergence. To preserve Japan’s territories, Coastal Cities sprung up, one after the other. Eventually, they became Marine Cities, and along with the expansion of sea-lanes to connect them, the need arose for a sizable staff to protect the seas. At the same time, maritime jobs were becoming more popular among women. Hence, the BLUE MERMAIDS had become every female student’s dream job.

All living things that hear the sounds, human and animal alike, lose consciousness. The phenomenon is assumed to be an unidentified virus, so due to fear of a spreading epidemic, Tokyo is blocked off from the rest of the country. About six months later, all the people who had lost consciousness awaken as if nothing ever happened. However, strange incidents start happening on that same day, and the city becomes engulfed by a chain of cruel destinies.

Main character Kakeru, his respected elder brother Suguru, and childhood friend Nana Mishima, along with all the teammates, rivals from other schools, and world class soccer players around him radiate their own brilliant light as they face adolescence with all their strength. The story also incorporates the strong bond between Kakeru and Suguru, the love of their family, the friendship of their teammates and rivals, and fleeting first loves... all coming together to ignite passion in the hearts of all viewers. 
 
The soccer depicted in The Knight in the Area does not rely upon the efforts of ""super athletes"" or nonsensical ""special techniques,"" but illustrates ""fanciful play"" as an extension of reality. Viewers will be drawn to this reality-based anime and its powerful scenes unfolding in realistic settings. Explanations of soccer rules and fundamentals are carefully presented as the story develops. It attempts to raise interest and understanding of elements such as formation diagrams for those unfamiliar with soccer, while depicting soccer in a way that enthusiasts can appreciate as the story of Kakeru's growth unfolds. The Knight in the Area appeals to a broader range of viewers than any anime ever has before. 
 
Kakeru is supported by his childhood friend Nana. Though she is the team manager, Nana is a soccer prodigy known as the Little Witch who goes on to join the Nadeshiko Japan women's soccer team. The Knight in the Area had its eye on the team even when it was still being serialized in Magazine, before women's soccer gained its current popularity. The anime's depiction of Nana's activity in Nadeshiko Japan is consistent with the present time.

            Meet Yugi and his best buds Joey, Tristan and Téa.  They share a love for the newest game that’s sweeping the nation: Duel Monsters! 
 
Legend has it 5000 years ago, ancient Egyptian Pharaohs used to play a magical game very similar to Duel Monsters.  This ancient game involved magical ceremonies, which were used to foresee the future and ultimately decide one’s destiny.  They called it the Shadow Games.  Since the game used so many magical spells and ferocious creatures, it wasn’t long before the game got out of hand and threatened to destroy the world.
